            <h2>☕ EPISODE 1: "The Coffee Stain That Changed Everything"</h2>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <p>[Scene 1: Kim Corporation Headquarters – Morning] </p>
                <p>
                    🏙️ The black limousine gleamed like a panther in the sunlight as it pulled up to Seoul's tallest glass tower. Kim Ha-eun 👸 (22) stepped out, her Valentino heels clicking against marble as employees bowed like reeds in the wind.
                    
                    Then—💥 CRASH!
                    
                    A blur of white shirt ☁️ and coffee cups 🫗 collided with her. Scalding liquid splashed across her $8,000 blouse.
                    
                    Ha-eun ❄️ (icy stare): "Are you blind?"
                    The Coffee Criminal 😏 (grinning as he wiped his hands on his cheap slacks): "No, just underpaid 💸."
                    
                    The lobby froze. Even the air conditioning seemed to stop ❄️.
                    
                    <p>[Scene 2: Elevator Encounter – 30 Minutes Later]</p>
                    <p>🔼 Ha-eun stabbed the penthouse button when the doors slid open to reveal—him. The coffee guy. Now wearing an intern badge: Lee Min-jae, Logistics 📛.
                    
                    Min-jae 🦊 (leaning against the wall): "So. Do I get fired 🔥 or executed ⚰️?"
                    
                    Her Cartier bracelet 💎 chose that moment to snap open. As the diamonds clattered toward the floor, his hand shot out—✋ caught them mid-air.
                    
                    Ha-eun 😳 (startled): "How did you—"
                    Min-jae 🖤 (fastening it with calloused fingers): "My mom was a jeweler 💍. Before she got sick 🤒."
                    
                    The doors opened on her floor. He saluted ✌️. "Try not to break anything else, princess 👑."</p>
                    
                    <p>[Scene 3: Penthouse Dinner – That Night]</p>
                    <p>🍽️ Father 👨💼 (over wagyu steak): "Choi Group's heir proposed 💍. You'll marry him next spring 🌸."
                    
                    Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, Ha-eun spotted a figure loading boxes 📦 into a truck in the rain 🌧️. Min-jae, drenched but still smiling at something on his phone 📱.
                    
                    Her fist clenched around her fork �.</p>
                    
                    <p>[Scene 4: Midnight Discovery]</p>
                    <p>🌙 Back in her office, Ha-eun found an origami crane 🕊️ on her desk. Unfolding it revealed jagged handwriting ✍️:
                    
                    "Rooftop storage shed 🏗️. Midnight 🌑.
                    – Still Not Fired (Yet) 🔥"</p>
                    
                    <p>[Final Scene: Security Office – 11:57 PM]</p>
                    
                    <p>🖥️ Security Chief 👨💻 (zooming in on elevator footage): "Sir... this Lee Min-jae..."
                    
                    The screen showed Min-jae 🎩 picking Ha-eun's office keycard from her pocket during the bracelet incident.
                    
                    Father 🥃 (sipping whiskey): "Run his background check again 🔍."
                    
                    The computer blinked: 🚨 NO RECORDS FOUND 🚨.</p>
